# The Last Conquest - Interactive Storytelling Website

## Overview

"The Last Conquest" is an interactive storytelling website designed to immerse users in a digital graphic novel experience. This project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (with Three.js for 3D effects) to create an engaging journey of a warriorâ€™s rise and fall, showcasing the themes of strength, sacrifice, and realization. The website features smooth scroll-based navigation, cinematic animations, background music, and parallax effects for a richer storytelling experience.

## Features

- **Interactive Storyline**: The story progresses through various chapters with smooth transitions.
- **Parallax Effect**: Background elements create depth during scrolling, adding an immersive touch.
- **Speech Bubbles**: Handwritten-style dialogues appear with smooth fade-in and motion effects.
- **Golden Button**: A glowing button used to navigate through the story.
- **Background Music**: A radio-style toggle to control the background music.
- **3D Sword Animation**: A rotating 3D sword displayed using Three.js, adding a dynamic effect to the website.
- **Responsive Design**: The site is fully responsive and adapts to various screen sizes.
